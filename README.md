Pure PHP, Laravel, Symfony, Ethereum: ICO, Smart contracts, Blockchain

 If you are looking for a full stack developer, who knows all aspects of his job, you have landed exactly at the right place.

I am the full stack web developer, and I have more five years of experience and related education in my field: I have finished Mogilev State Polytechnical College with Information Technologies Software area of study. I can take your idea from scratch and make a working project with happy customers. I am life and work in ​Belarus - the country with really talented and passionate developers. What others are talking about us:

“If you have a mission impossible project in software development, send it to Belarus.”
― Drew Guff, managing director and founding partner of Siguler Guff & Company.

“Belarus focuses on the quality, preferring to hire one highly qualified specialist instead of 10 novices.”
― The FORBES Magazine.

My vision of the whole picture is what differentiates me from other candidates. It is including an in-depth understanding of all technical parts of the process from the server-side to the client-side and understating all human processes and readiness to work in the team according to best practices and methodologies (Agile, Kanban).

I believe teamwork is the key, so freelance is the place where I meet great people, and together we make brilliant things. I am a very talkative person, and I am always let you know about the status of the project and development.

I do not work with every client — I also interview everyone, because good projects evolve not only from a good developer but in collaboration with the good developer and adequate client. That is why I ask many questions for every design job and don't accept the projects before the interview. I do not do cheap work (though I am flexible in quoting, depending on who you are) because every job should be paid. I prefer challenging and exciting projects because it makes me work at 200% as mad and I love this feeling. Please, keep it in mind and don’t disturb me with "another WordPress project."
If this is not your case, contact me right now — let's start working.
